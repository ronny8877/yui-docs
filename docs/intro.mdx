# Get started with Yui

### Installation

Yugam UI web components are simple custom elements that can be used in your web application.
We use the shadow DOM to create a virtual DOM for the web components and all the styles there so you don't have to worry about yui Web-components to collide with any of your own styling and Logic. 



<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="Node">

```bash
 npm install -save yui
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CDN">

```html
<script src="link here"></script>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Yarn">

``` bash
yarn install yui
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



:::tip

We are continously working on improving the performance of the components and making them more robust as well as adding new components.
